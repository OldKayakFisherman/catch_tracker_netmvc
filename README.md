### What this application is

This project is meant to demonstrate a trivial application built in C# and ASP.NET MVC technologies. Showcasing my knowledge of these technologies and deviating from the standard TODO lists so common in most online tutorials.

As an avid kayak fisherman intimately familiar with the subject matter, I could play both Product Owner and Developer and build an app in these technologies to showcase my technical ability.

### What this application is not

    - Secure (Registration, Login, Logout)
    - Feature rich UI (Basic Bootstrap used)
    - Highly normalized database
    - Fully 508 Compliant

### Application Improvements
    - Implement User Security (Registration, Login, Logout, Session Handling, Route Gaurds)
    - User Experience Engineering
    - Database normalization, postgresql migration
    - Improve 508 Compliance
